# ☕ Coffee Machine Simulation – Python Project
A beginner-friendly Coffee Machine Simulation built using core Python concepts. This console-based project simulates a real-world coffee vending machine that lets users select drinks, checks resources, handles payments, and brews coffee — all through terminal input.

Developed by **Tejas Nivrutti Divase**

# 🔧 Features
Choose from multiple drinks: Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino

Resource check before brewing

Accepts coins and calculates change

Displays current machine report (ingredients & money)

Loop-based system with exit command

Built using only core Python (no external libraries)

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3

Functions and conditionals

Loops and dictionaries

Basic math and string formatting

# 💡 How It Works
The machine offers Espresso, Latte, or Cappuccino.

User inserts coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies).

Machine checks if there are enough ingredients.

If payment is sufficient, it brews coffee and updates resources.

Users can type "report" to check remaining ingredients or "off" to shut down.

# 📸 Sample Output
What would you like? (espresso/latte/cappuccino):
Please insert coins.
How many quarters?: 3
...
Here is your latte ☕. Enjoy!

# 📌 Future Enhancements
Add GUI using Tkinter

Track user coffee history

Auto-refill system for ingredients

Add animations with Turtle or Pygame

Voice-controlled coffee orders (with SpeechRecognition)
